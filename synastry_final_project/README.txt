HELLO SYNASTRY TEAM THIS IS YOUSIF SPEAKING!


I Wanted to update you all on the progress! 


So for a visual update, please watch the video I sent to the groupchat but main updates



- ALL screens should now be able to be navigated to!
- All planets go to their own unique planet screens
- Each planet screen gives you access to that planets info
- Each planet has its own image component, name component, and id
- the sun has a working image upload feature, as well as a text box for the whats hot!
- The planet search feature has a working input text box!


Next Steps (feel free to add to this!):


- Make sure that changes persist throughout different screen changes (for example, if I upload an image and click off the sun, right now that wont persist)
    - To do this, either add parameters to teh current dictionary or define a new global dictionary to store this info, and use conditionals for what view to end up showign

- Make sure that the search feature can take you to 2-3 mock planet screens
    - make the mock planet screens
    - call navigate to updated "search" value if its one of the mocks, otherwise it does nothing (only direct searches should work)

- Style the app :)


That should be all! We're super close we got this yall!!
